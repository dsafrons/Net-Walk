# Net-Walk

Net-Walk is a Python puzzle prototype inspired by the classic **Net** puzzle from [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/).  
The goal is to generate and play through simple network-walking levels.

## Features

- Procedural level generation (`level_generator.py`)
- "Walking" mechanics to highlight path and main game functions (`main.py`)
- Clear structure for extending with new rules or visuals
